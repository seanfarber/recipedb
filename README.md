Introduction

The recipe database allows for searching for recipes by category or name. Links to the recipes appear below the search form after the form is submitted. When a link is selected, a page showing that recipe is displayed. Edit and Delete buttons are only shown when a user is logged in.

When a user logs in, the navigation bar shows links to add recipes and view users. When the logout link is activated, the links disappear. The users link shows all users in the database and the add recipe link loads a form to enter new recipes.

Functionality

This project makes use of MySQL SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE statements using stored procedures. A trigger is fired when a recipe is deleted that inserts that recipeâ€™s data into a table call recipe_audit.
